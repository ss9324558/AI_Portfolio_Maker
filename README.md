## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ss9324558/AI_Portfolio_Maker.git
cd AI_Portfolio_Maker
````

### 2. Install Dependencies (root, frontend & backend)

```bash
npm install 
cd frontend && npm install  # installs  frontend deps
cd ../backend && npm install # installs  backend deps
```

Or use the root command if workspaces are configured.
## 3. Database Setup (Backend)

Before running the backend server, you need to create the PostgreSQL `users` table.

### Manual Table Creation
Manually execute the following SQL in your PostgreSQL client:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  address TEXT,
  date_of_birth DATE
);

---

## 🔄 Run the Project

You can run both frontend and backend from the **root folder** using:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start both servers concurrently in development mode.

If you want to run them separately, you can do so by navigating to each folder:
```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev  # starts Next.js frontend
cd ../backend && npm run dev # starts Express backend
```

This uses `concurrently` to run both servers:

* Frontend runs at: `http://localhost:3000`
* Backend runs at: `http://localhost:8080` (or configured port)

---
